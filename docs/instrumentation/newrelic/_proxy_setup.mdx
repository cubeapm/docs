Set up a proxy for New Relic agent.

New Relic agent has a limitation: it only send data over HTTPS on port 443. However, CubeAPM receives data on port 3130 over HTTP. To bridge this gap, you need to set up a proxy (load balancer or HTTP reverse proxy) that:

- Accepts HTTPS traffic on port 443 from the New Relic agent
- Forwards this traffic to your CubeAPM server on port 3130 over HTTP

For example, you can set up an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) with the following configuration:

- **Listener Configuration:**

  - Protocol: HTTPS
  - Port: 443
  - Domain name: `cubeapm-newrelic.yourdomain.com` (example domain for your load balancer)
  - SSL/TLS Certificate: Certificate for `cubeapm-newrelic.yourdomain.com` or `\*.yourdomain.com` (from ACM or imported)

- **Target Group Configuration:**

  - Protocol: HTTP
  - Port: 3130
  - Target: Your CubeAPM server IP or DNS name (e.g., `cubeapm-server.yourdomain.com`)
  - Health check path: `/health`

- **Security Groups:**

  - **Load Balancer Security Group:**

    - Inbound rule: Allow HTTPS (port 443) from your application servers' IPs or security groups
    - Outbound rule: Allow HTTP (port 3130) to the CubeAPM server's IP or security group

  - **CubeAPM Server Security Group:**
    - Inbound rule: Allow HTTP (port 3130) from the load balancer's security group
    - Outbound rule: Allow all traffic (or as per your security requirements)

The New Relic agent will connect to the load balancer's domain name (`cubeapm-newrelic.yourdomain.com` in this example), which will then forward the traffic to your CubeAPM server on port 3130.
