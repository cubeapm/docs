# Instrumentation

CubeAPM understands Open Telemetry Protocol (OTLP) natively. So it can be used to monitor applications written in a wide variety of programming languages/frameworks. We have documentation for connecting applications written in some of the most popular languages/frameworks in this section (see left sidebar). Documentation for a wider range of languages/frameworks is available on the official [Open Telemetry website](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/).
