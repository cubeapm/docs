# Supported Platforms

Cube is written in Go and ReactJS. All the code is compiled and packaged in a single binary, with no external dependency. It can be installed on Linux and Mac platforms with 64-bit Intel/AMD/ARM processors.

Cube works on OTLP (Open Telemetry Protocol). So it can be used to monitor applications written in a wide variety of programming languages and running on a wide variety of hardware platforms. We have documentation for connecting applications written in some of the mostnpopular languages/frameworks in the [Instrumentation](../../Instrumentation/) section. Documentation for a wider range of languages/frameworks is available at the official [Open Telemetry website](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/).
