# Introduction

Cube is written in Go and ReactJS. All the code is packaged in a single binary. Cube can handle 10K traces per second on a single machine with just 2 vCPUs and 8 GB memory (tested on AWS t4g.large instance; on demand pricing: $0.0672/hour, i.e., $1.6/day), and can scale linearly with more resources.

Please follow the instructions below to download and install Cube. We support Linux and Mac platforms with 64-bit Intel/AMD/ARM processors.
