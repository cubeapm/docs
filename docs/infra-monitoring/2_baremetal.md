# Bare Metal / Virtual Machine

The recommended setup for infra monitoring with CubeAPM is to use OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collector for collecting the metrics from host machines and sending them to CubeAPM. CubeAPM then provides visualization and alerting on the collected metrics.

OTel Collector can be installed on Linux, Windows, and Mac. Pre-built packages for popular package managers (apt, rpm, etc.) are available at https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases. Visit the link, look for `Assets` for the latest release, and click on `Show all xxx assets` link at the bottom of the assets list. Then look at links starting with `otelcol-contrib_` and find the appropriate one for your os platform. For example, the one for Ubuntu running on 64-bit ARM processors will be named like `otelcol-contrib_xxx_linux_arm64.deb`.

:::info
There are two variants of OTel Collector available - **core** (names starting with `otelcol_`) and **contrib** (names starting with `otelcol-contrib_`). The core variant is bare-bones, while the contrib variant has a number of additional modules. Infra monitoring makes use of many of these additional modules, and hence needs the contrib variant.

## Installation

Here we show the installation steps for Ubuntu. Steps for other linux variants are similar. (See the bottom of this section for installation on Windows)

```shell
# change the link to the appropriate link for your os, cpu architecture, collector version, etc.
wget https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/releases/download/v0.96.0/otelcol-contrib_0.96.0_linux_arm64.deb

dpkg -i otelcol-contrib_0.96.0_linux_arm64.deb

# the package file can now be removed
# rm otelcol-contrib_0.96.0_linux_arm64.deb

# edit the config as desired (refer the configuration section below)
vi /etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml

# restart collector service
systemctl restart otelcol-contrib.service
systemctl status otelcol-contrib.service
```

<details>
<summary>Installation on Windows</summary>

1. Download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for windows platform.
1. Unzip it by executing `tar -xzf <filename>` command in powershell.
1. Update config.yaml as desired (refer the configuration section below).
1. Run the Collector by executing `otelcol-contrib.exe --config config.yaml` in powershell.

The Collector can be set up as a background service as follows:

```shell
# Create windows service.
# Modify the paths of otelcol-contrib.exe and config.yaml as appropriate.
# Ref: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-create
sc.exe create otelcol displayname= otelcol start= delayed-auto binPath= "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\otelcol-contrib\otelcol-contrib.exe --config C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\otelcol-contrib\config.yaml"

# Useful commands
sc.exe start otelcol
sc.exe query otelcol
sc.exe delete otelcol

# To check the logs, open event viewer > windows logs > application,
# and then filter source=otelcol on right hand side.
```

## Configuration
