# Archive

CubeAPM supports archiving logs data to Object stores like AWS S3 (or any object store with S3-compatible APIs), Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and Azure Blob Storage.

Archived logs can be queried seamlessly in real-time. Both CubeAPM UI and APIs fetch logs automatically from local storage and/or archive as required.

Please follow the links below for configuration according to deployment environment.
